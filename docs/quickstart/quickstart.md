# Putting it all together

Assuming you've been able to:

* [Installed](installation.md) `snpQT`
* Picked and maybe configured [a profile](profiles.md)
* Set up your own [parameter file](parameters.md)

You're now ready to run `snpQT`:

```
nextflow run nebfield/snpqt -params-file <path_to_params_file> -profile standard,singularity -w <path_to_work_dir> -resume
```

* `<path_to_params_file>` is the filepath of a parameter file that you have
  configured e.g. `$HOME/test_run.yaml`
* `<path_to_work_dir>` is the filepath to a directory that will store
  intermediate files generated by the pipeline. This directory is used to make
  checkpoints and allows `-resume` to continue work if the pipeline stops. The
  directory can get quite big.

Once the pipeline finishes, a summary analysis ond your output data will be
published to the directory you specify in the parameter file.

A simple full example using the provided toy dataset:

```
$ nextflow info nebfield/snpqt
$ nextflow run nebfield/snpqt -params-file $HOME/.nextflow/assets/nebfield/snpqt/parameters.yaml -profile standard,conda -w $HOME/work
$ cp -r $HOME/.nextflow/assets/nebfield/snpqt/results $HOME/snpqt_toy_results
```

Feel free to inspect the reports generated in `$HOME/snpqt_toy_results`. The
reports will look a bit odd because the input data is synthetic. 

There are nine individual workflows in `snpQT`. We provide a detailed
explanation of each workflow in the [user guide](../user-guide/tutorial.md)
section.
